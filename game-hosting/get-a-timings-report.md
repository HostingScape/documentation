# Get a timings report

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** only Spigot-related servers should be able to get a timings report. (Paper Purpur..)
{% endhint %}

To grab a timings report link, you only need to start your server as usual, then wait around 5-10 minutes. (The more time, the better, we recommend 10 minutes). After that, run on the server console page the following command: `timings report`. This should give you a link to debug any performance issues.
