# Lag issues

## Explanation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** lag might not be a server-side issue, but a client (user)-side issue.
{% endhint %}

### Server lag

In case of the lag is identified as "server-lag" (low TPS, etc), you can create a ticket and we'll try to debug your server to check for issues. You can also grab a timings report link and post it on the #public-support Discord channel. Our support bot should automatically reply with what you need to fix and what you need to change. ([get-a-timings-report.md](../get-a-timings-report.md "mention")) If this still doesn't work for you, please create a ticket.

### Ping lag

If you're suffering from ping issues and confirmed it isn't your issue (speed, wifi issue), please do the following: [get-an-mtr.md](get-an-mtr.md "mention")
