# Get an MTR

If you have confirmed that the lag is not related to your server (TPS, for example), and it's related to ping issues, an MTR is required.

### Windows

In order to run an MTR inside Windows:

1. Download an MTR software such as [WinMTR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/).
2. Extract the downloaded file and open the folder.
3. Depending if your PC is x32 or x64, you will need to open the corresponding folder. If you're not sure, then it's most likely x64.
4. Run `WinMTR.exe`
5. Enter the server IP address in the "host" field. The IP for Game Hosting is: (`game.usa.galaxynodes.host`) or `104.255.230.203`
6. Click "Start" and let it run for at least a minute or more.
7. Afterwards, you can either:

&#x20;     a. Send a screenshot of the result to us on a ticket.

&#x20;     b. Click "EXPORT TEXT". A .txt file should be saved. Send us the file and we'll look into it.

Aand.. you're done!



### macOS & Linux
